## Overview
This repository is dedicated to studying machine learning techniques for time-series forecasting. 
Machine learning supervised models (e.g.: linear regression, random forest etc.) can be used for time series if seasonality can be put into a variable. 


Methods for the most affecting time parameters (e.g.: hour, day, year)
and lags have been developed earlier [Target Variable - Feature Engineering](https://github.com/SwatiInd/Time-Series-Analysis/blob/main/TargetVariableProcessing.py). These methods would be extensively used in data exploration here. 

In this repository, following examples are included:
1. XGB Regressor - [xgb_Electricity Consumption](https://github.com/SwatiInd/Time-Series-Machine-Learning/blob/main/XGB%20Regressor%20-%20Electricity%20Consumption.ipynb)
