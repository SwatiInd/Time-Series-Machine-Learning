## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing machine learning techniques for time-series forecasting. 
Machine learning supervised models (e.g.: linear regression, random forest etc.) can be used for time series if seasonality can be put into a variable. 
Also, the autocorrelation effects needs to be added in input variables. Methods for identifying strong time parameters 
and lags have been developed earlier [Target Variable - Feature Engineering](https://github.com/SwatiInd/Time-Series-Analysis/blob/main/TargetVariableProcessing.py) 
and would be extensively used in developing models.

In this repository, following examples are included:
1. XGB Regressor - [xgb_Electricity Consumption](https://github.com/SwatiInd/Time-Series-Machine-Learning/blob/main/XGB%20Regressor%20-%20Electricity%20Consumption.ipynb)
